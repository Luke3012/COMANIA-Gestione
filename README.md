# COMANIA Gestione

COMANIA Gestione is a lightweight and rudimentary order management software originally built to handle daily operations in a small technology shop.  
Developed at a young age, it operates entirely through folders and plain text files, making it simple, portable, and easy to understand.

## Features

- **Order Management:** Keep track of incoming orders and their details using text-based storage.
- **Receipt Printing:** Generate and print small receipts or labels to attach to items, avoiding misplacement.
- **Deadline Sorting:** Automatically sort orders by due date to prioritize urgent tasks.
- **Multi-user Support:** Up to 5 users can work on the system simultaneously.
- **File-based Operation:** No database required — runs purely on the file system.

## Requirements

- Windows operating system (tested on legacy versions).
- A basic printer for receipt/label printing.
- No installation of external databases or complex dependencies.

## How It Works

COMANIA Gestione stores all data in structured folders and text files. Orders are added manually or through the program’s interface, and tasks are displayed in deadline order.  
Receipt printing creates a small physical label to keep track of each order’s status and details.

## Limitations

- Intended for small-scale use.
- No modern database or cloud sync.
- Interface and workflow are intentionally minimal.
